# Week-09-Crypto,SSH Part-1
## Thuersday March 26 th (08.30-12.00 for both classes).

_This is going to be a pretty heavy week when it comes to theory. Most of the exercises will not involve code, but steps necessary to understand and USE the terms below, and see how they are all required to get a secure connection in a browser_
- SSH and SSH Tunnels
- Introduction to Symmetric and Asymmetric Encryption
- Different ways to set up a Remote Database Server
- Monitoring a SSH handshake with wireshark


## What to Prepare
Read the first pages in todays exercises, and set up the two droplets as explained in the section "Setting up the two required Droplets"
Do this either in a team, or do it for your self. You can **delete the droplets** when you are done with the hand-in for this week.

This should take less than 15-20 min. (for both droplets) if you follow the instructions carefully
